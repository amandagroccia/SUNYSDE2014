Dear Kelly Thomas,

I asked for permission to make use of some matlab code that was published i=
n the education section of the SIAM review. We would like to use the code a=
nd make it available to others (with appropriate attributions to SIAM and t=
he author) in a way that would allow them to copy and use the code as well.=
 Can we make use of the code? The exchange can be found in the replies belo=
w.

Sincerely,
kelly Black

Hi Des:

Thanks for your e-mail.  I'm going to forward this request to Kelly Thomas =
(Thomas@siam.org) here at SIAM because she handles the official granting of=
 permission.

Dear Kelly,
 cc Elizabeth Greenspan,

 Thanks for your message.

 Yes, I have no problem with this---the short MATLAB codes are already in t=
he public domain via my own website, and  I encourage people to use and exp=
eriment with them.

 I am copying in Elizabeth Greenspan at SIAM for info: Elizabeth, the codes=
 appear in a SIAM Review Review article:
  An algorithmic introduction to numerical simulation of stochastic differe=
ntial equations, by D. J. Higham, SIAM Review, Education Section, 43, 2001,=
 525-546.

 Thanks for your interest in this work.

Best wishes,
Des Higham

Dear Dr. Higham,

I am a faculty member at Clarkson University in the United States. We have =
a summer program for undergraduate students to introduce them to research i=
n mathematics. I have a group of three students, and as part of our work we=
 are reading your paper An Algorithmic Introduction to Numerical Simulation=
 of Stochastic Differential equations. We are grateful that you make them a=
vailable, and we find them to be a great way to introduce the idea of stoch=
astic integration and gain some experience with the basic ideas.

I am having my students use your matlab files, and making changes to experi=
ment with them. We have been sharing the files, but it has been awkward to =
work together on these particular files. Part of the reason is that we are =
using github.com to share our work.

The github website allows us to share files and keep them coordinated.
The website requires that all public repositories make all work available f=
or free and use a license that allows people to share our work. (We are usi=
ng the MIT license for all of our codes.) We would like to add our codes ba=
sed on your matlab files.

Is it okay to add your files to our repository? We would add a copyright he=
ader with your name as the original author. The copyright header would also=
 include a copy of the MIT license giving anybody else permission to copy a=
nd change the code:
http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

We would be grateful if you would allow us to share your work, and it would=
 be extremely helpful for us.

Sincerely,
Kelly Black
